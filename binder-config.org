* Setup Google Cloud with Kubernetes
** DONE Make free Google Cloud account

+ This gives me 300 USD credit to use over 6 months
+ But there are also "always free" resources, which I will try and stick to
** Setup Kubernetes engine on Google Cloud
+ [X] Create cluster
  + I have changed the machine type to micro so I won't use up any credit
  + And gone for only 3 nodes, which is the minimum
** Install kubernetes and gcloud stuff locally
+ Command line stuff, such as kubectl, from homebrew
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install kubernetes-cli
  #+END_SRC
+ [X] Ah, actually maybe we should use the Google Cloud SDK
  + https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-macos
  + [X] Installed in [[file:~/Source/google-cloud-sdk/]]
  + [X] Configure: ~gcloud init~, which prompted me to log in to my Google account in a browser
  + [X] Install gcloud version of Kubernetes CLI
    + ~gcloud components install kubectl~
      + Installs version 1.9.7
    + This warns about an "older" version in my PATH, which is the homebrew one, which is actually newer (1.11)
      + Hopefully, this won't cause a problem
** Set up local machine to talk to kubernetes cluster
Following tutorial at https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gcloud container clusters list
#+END_SRC

: NAME       LOCATION       MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE  NODE_VERSION  NUM_NODES  STATUS
: cluster-1  us-central1-a  1.9.7-gke.5     35.193.92.175  f1-micro      1.9.7-gke.5   3          RUNNING

So cluster is called ~cluster-1~.  Note that I didn't need to do ~gcloud container clusters create ...~ since I had already done that in the web interface

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster-1
#+END_SRC

: Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
: kubeconfig entry generated for cluster-1.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kubectl get nodes
#+END_SRC

: NAME                                       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
: gke-cluster-1-default-pool-3322f256-54fd   Ready     <none>    44m       v1.9.7-gke.5
: gke-cluster-1-default-pool-3322f256-pm2w   Ready     <none>    44m       v1.9.7-gke.5
: gke-cluster-1-default-pool-3322f256-wwrf   Ready     <none>    44m       v1.9.7-gke.5

Hurray, we now have them recognized by ~kubectl~

I am skipping the rest of the tutorial, since I have no interest in deploying their ~hello-app~
